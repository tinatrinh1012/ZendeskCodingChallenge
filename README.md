Coding challenge for Zendesk Engineering Co-op Program 2021

This is a Ticket Viewer CLI program written in Java for the coding challenge for Zendesk Engineering Co-op Program 2021 interview process. The program connects with Zendesk API to request tickets information and display tickets that exist in the account. Tickets are either displayed in a list or individually with more details. When more than 25 tickets are returned, the program pages through the tickets.

To run this program:
- Download the code or clone the project to your local working directory
- Make sure you have an appropriate up-to-date version of JDK that is compatible with the project downloaded and installed
- Open the project in an IDE of your preference (IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, etc.)
- Go to src → main → java → org → example → App.java,
- Use your IDE feature to run "App.java" to run the program

The program will run and display information in your console/terminal, in which you can type in your input to interact with the program.
